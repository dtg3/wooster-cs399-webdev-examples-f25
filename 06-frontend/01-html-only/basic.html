<!-- 
    All HTML files need the DOCTYPE declaration
    at the top of the file. Without it, most 
    web browsers will go into a type of guessing
    mode where the will make assumptions about
    how to parse the document. Explicityly declaring
    the documents type allows the browser to be more
    accurate in the way it interprets the file.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
    HTML tags are not case sensitive, so just be
    consistent. DOCTYPE in most examples of the HTML
    spec is capitalized due to it's special purpose,
    but lower case works as well.
-->

<!-- Indicates the start of an HTML document -->
<html>
    <!-- 
        HTML is a hierarchical document, so we
        indent accordingly. Tags in between other
        tags are indented.
    -->

    <!-- 
        The head tag defines some properties (metadata) for our HTML document.
        In this basic case we will supply a title tag to show the name of our
        site/webpage in our browser. Every html page should have a title.
    -->
    <head>
        <title>My Cool Website Demo</title>
    </head>

    <!--
        Indicates the start of content to be rendered
        on the HTML page by the browser.

        <!-- 
            h1 is a Header1 tag indicates text displayed with
            a large font size to serve as a sort of title for content.
            header tags have numbers 1-6 where 1 is largest and 6 is
            the smallest. Note that the text is inclosed with an end tag
            which is usually the same tag as a starting tag, but includes
            a / in between the < and the tag name. Not all tags require
            end tags.
        -->
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>

        <!--
            p is the paragraph tag which indicates a section of text.
            Your browser will automatically put a blank line of white space
            in between content that comes before and after the <p> tag.
        -->
        <p>I just made a webpage!</p>
        <p>
            You can find plenty of information about HTML tags from online resources like:
        </p>

        <!-- 
            Unordered list <ul> shows a bulleted list each <li> is a list item. You can
            create and ordered list using the <ol> tag and the <li> tags
        -->
        <ul>
            <li>
                <!-- 
                    The <a> tag is an anchor. This looks a bit different than the tags we have
                    seen so far. Achors can link to other websites, or other locations in the same
                    HTML document. Note the href= and the target= content. HTML tags can have additional
                    properties called attributes. In the case of the anchor tag, the href attribute 
                    allows us to provide a URL to another site as a link the text between the <a> tags
                    is clicked. The target attribute allows us to define behavior when clicking the link.
                    In this case, we want the link to open in a new tab instead of taking us away from our
                    current page. The "_blank" value is a documented constant to say open in a new "blank"
                    tab.

            The div tag is for division and can create sections in your code. There are other tags to achieve a
            similar effect, but div implies that we are simply separating content and not that the content is in
            any way related. Other tags imply a relationship between the content. Like with the p tag, a blank
            line is added before and after the div tag. Div tags become handy when we want to create stylistic
            looks for certain sections of the site...more on this later...
