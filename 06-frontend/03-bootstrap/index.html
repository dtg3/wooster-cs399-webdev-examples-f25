        Supports proper responsive (screen size) behavior

        Basically, mobile browsers are told to render the web page at a 
        width that matches the device's screen width and at a 100% zoom 
        level, ensuring a consistent and readable layout across
        different devices.

        Containers are responsive and adjust the content size according to defined width
        breakpoints (imagine various desktop monitor sizes, phones, tablets, or when
        resizing the browser window)

        py-2 is a padding for the container of 2 units. These units are based on a scale defined by
        Bootstrap using a variable called $spacer and usually defaults to 1rem (root em). An rem scales to the
        font size of the HTML document. So if the font used on the document is 16px, 1rem is 16px, 2rem is 32px, etc.
        
        These are the units and their calculations for bootstraps units (from their online docs):
            0 - for classes that eliminate the margin or padding by setting it to 0
            1 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25
            2 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .5
            3 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer
            4 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 1.5
            5 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 3
            auto - for classes that set the margin to auto

                Bootstrap focuses on a 12 column layout 
                Why 12? Flexible partitioning of space:
                    Halves (12/6)
                    Thirds (12/4)
                    Quarters (12/3)
                    Sixths (12/2)
                    Twelves (12/12)
                    and a single unit (12/1)

                col-5 says reserve 5 columns of space for the content.
                justify-content-end aligns the content to the right side of the column.
                d-flex is a utility class to make the alignment possible.
